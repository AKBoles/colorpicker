# üîç Debug Guide: Image Upload Not Working

## Problem
You click "Upload an image", select a file, but nothing happens.

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Commit the Debug Version
First, commit and deploy the debug version I just created:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "üîß Add debugging for upload issue"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Open Browser Developer Tools
1. Go to your deployed site: https://colorpicker-di5x.onrender.com/
2. **Right-click** ‚Üí **Inspect** ‚Üí **Console tab**
3. Clear the console (click the üöÆ icon)

### Step 3: Test Upload & Check Console
1. Click the upload area
2. Select an image file
3. **Watch the console messages**

You should see messages like:
```javascript
